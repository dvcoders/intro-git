## Intro Git

> Learn about publishing you projects to Github, reverting you work, and pushing/pulling to Github!

Into Git will walk you though the essentials in using Git (software) and publishing it to Github (website). 

Git is the industry standard in version control software, and **nearly every technology company** uses Git to collaborate on their products.

Git allows many people to work on the same code effectively and efficiently - anywhere from 1 to 10,000 developers! (many more if you want).

### [Guide](./reference/README.md)

The guide for Intro Git will walk you through the concepts of Git and Github, explaining what each command means and why it is used.

This is a good to refer back to when you're using Git on your own work (because it can be tricky!)

Definitely checkout `Best Practices` and `Learning Resources` sections at the bottom for more links to useful material!

### [Workshop](./workshop/README.md)

This where you can practice Git and Github by making your own repository, adding files, committing and pushing to Github!

If you'd like this can be done on your own time - it's written step-by-step for you to follow along!

You can always ask us any questions about Git or Github on the [dvcoders Slack](https://dvcoders.slack.com) :heart:
